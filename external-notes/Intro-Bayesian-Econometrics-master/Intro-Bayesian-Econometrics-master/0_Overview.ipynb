    "## Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introductory course in Bayesian econometrics. The intended audience is graduate students and researchers in economics, finance and related fields. My objective is to get you to a position where you have the ability to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Contrast classical and Bayesian thinking in econometrics\n",
    "2. Estimate commonly used econometric models using Bayesian methods\n",
    "3. Create original pieces of research using Bayesian methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the models that we consider will be useful for modeling time-series data, however the estimation methods can also be applied to either cross-sectional or panel data. Topics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overview of Bayesian thinking: how it differs from classical/frequentist thinking\n",
    "2. Posterior simulation via Monte Carlo Integration and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods: Gibbs Sampling and Metropolis-Hastings algorithms\n",
    "3. Estimation and application of some commonly used models: linear regression with various error structures, vector autoregression and state-space models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisite knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "I assume that you've already taken courses in introductory probability and statistics as well as (classical) econometrics and time series analysis.\n",

    "### Course Material\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the course material can be downloaded from [my GitHub page](https://github.com/Jamie-L-Cross/Bayes). We won't be following any textbook, however I highly recommend that you obtain a copy of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Notes on Bayesian Macroeconometrics](http://joshuachan.org/notes_BayesMacro.html) by Joshua CC Chan. This collection of notes contains most of the algorithms and models that we will learn in this course with associated MATLAB codes.\n",
    "2. [Bayesian Econometrics](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Econometrics-Gary-Koop/dp/0470845678) by Gary Koop. Gary provides great intuition for Bayesian thinking and also covers some of the models that we will consider in this course.\n",
    "3. [Bayesian Econometric Methods (Econometric Exercises)](https://www.amazon.com/Bayesian-Econometric-Methods-Exercises/dp/0521671736), by Joshua CC Chan, Gary Koop, Dale Poirier and Justin Tobias. This is a book of exercises and associated MATLAB codes. It is an extremely useful companion to Josh and Gary's textbooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these resources, you might find the following useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) website for economic modeling (in both Julia and Python)\n",
    "2. [Ben Lambert](https://ben-lambert.com/about/) has a book called [A Studentâ€™s Guide to Bayesian Statistics](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Students-Guide-Bayesian-Statistics/dp/1473916364/) which is targeted at students without any previous knowledge of statistics nor probability. He also has some great videos on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/SpartacanUsuals/playlists).\n",

    "### Jupyter notebooks with Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the lectures will be delivered using [The Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) in which we will use the programming language [Julia](https://julialang.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Common uses include data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation and statistical modeling. The reason I'm using the notebooks is that they allow for an interactive classroom in which we can do math and estimate models without the need to switch programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, The Jupyter Notebook allow you to use the programming language [Python](https://www.python.org/), however it supports over 40 programming languages, including Julia. Both Python and Julia are open source and free to use, however I have chosen to use Julia because (1) it's [syntax](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/) is easier to write when doing matrix computations (which we will do a lot of in this course) and (2) it's [faster](https://julialang.org/benchmarks/). Further nice comparison of the two languages can be found [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/julia-vs-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "I assume that most people aren't familiar with either The Jupyter Notebook or Julia, but will assume that you can set them up and teach yourself the basics. As a first step, I recommend that you try [the online demo](https://jupyter.org/try).\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple step-by-step guide to installing both Julia and The Jupyter Notebook can be found [here](https://datatofish.com/add-julia-to-jupyter/). Installing these two programs will allow you to run all of the codes used in the lectures through The Jupyter Notebook. Alternatively, you can run them online via [cocalc.com](cocalc.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about The Jupyter Notebook and Julia, then I highly recommend:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Julia Tutorials](https://datatofish.com/julia-tutorials/) by [Data to Fish](https://datatofish.com/)\n",
    "2. [Getting Started with Julia](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/index.html) from [this lecture series](https://julia.quantecon.org/index_toc.html) by [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use Julia to run programs outside of The Jupyter Notebook (useful for research), then you will need a text editor such as [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Juno](http://docs.junolab.org/latest/man/installation/). This [discussion on specifying the Julia path](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/set-julia-path-in-juno/37417) may also be useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Jula vs MATLAB\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you with coding experience in the programming language MATLAB (like myself), note that Julia's syntax is almost identical. [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/) provide a nice [cheat cheat](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/) that compares the two languages syntax (along with Python) as well as a list of [Julia's advantages](https://julia.quantecon.org/about_lectures.html) over MATLAB and other programming languages. The main reason that I've chosen to use Julia instead of MATLAB is that it's compatible with The Jupyter Notebook and therefore great for teaching. Others might like the fact that it's (1) free and (2) fast. The cost of using Julia is that (1) you have to manually install libraries to use certain functions (2) it has fewer libraries than MATLAB and (3) it doesn't have any customer support. That being said, there are a bunch of [Julia packages](https://julialang.org/packages/) available with more popping up everyday, as well as a [forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/) where you might find a solution to your problem or even post a question that other users can answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you're still not convinced about making the switch from MATLAB to Julia then you can stick with MATLAB and convert the provided Julia codes using the [cheat cheat](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/). This will not impact your overall grade in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--- HTML tags for comments\n",
    "We will mostly focus on the implementation of a class of powerful algorithms known as [Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) methods, referencing theory where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Further reading\n",
    "Throughout the lectures I will provide references to related content that I find useful. Unfortunately we won't be able to cover everything. Here is a list of references on further topics:\n",

    "**Bayesian Identification of BVAR models**\n",
