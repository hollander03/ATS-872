# Advanced Time Series 872 

These course notes are for the section on Bayesian econometrics. Incomplete, but frequently updated. 

The `notebooks/dynamic/` folder contains all the interactive `Pluto` notebooks for this class. To get started with Pluto, please visit the [Github page](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) or watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOjKEgbt8AI)  

# Rough course outline

0. **[Self Study]** Introduction to Julia from [José Eduardo Storopoli](https://github.com/storopoli/Julia-Workshop)
1. Sampling, random variables and distributions -- [Lecture #1 Notebook](https://raw.githack.com/DawievLill/AdvancedTimeSeries-872/main/notebooks/static/lecture1-sampling.jl.html)
2. Bayesian thinking (Bernoulli / Binomial) -- [Lecture #2 Notebook](https://raw.githack.com/DawievLill/AdvancedTimeSeries-872/main/notebooks/static/lecture2-bayes.jl.html)
3. Starting with simulation (Normal) -- [Lecture #3 Notebook](https://raw.githack.com/DawievLill/AdvancedTimeSeries-872/main/notebooks/static/lecture3-normal.jl.html)
4. Markov chain Monte Carlo -- [Lecture #4 Notebook](https://raw.githack.com/DawievLill/AdvancedTimeSeries-872/main/notebooks/static/lecture4-mcmc.jl.html)
5. Bayesian linear regression -- [Lecture #5 Notebook](https://raw.githack.com/DawievLill/AdvancedTimeSeries-872/main/notebooks/static/lecture5-regression.jl.html)
6. Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVARs) -- [Lecture #6 Notebook](https://raw.githack.com/DawievLill/AdvancedTimeSeries-872/main/notebooks/static/lecture6-bvar.jl.html)
7. State space models / Kalman filter -- [State space models](https://julia.quantecon.org/tools_and_techniques/linear_models.html) and [Kalman filter](https://julia.quantecon.org/tools_and_techniques/kalman.html)
8. Dynamic factor models and FAVARs
9. Time varying parameter models (TVP-VARs)
10. Deep learning for time series analysis

`R` code for many of the lectures will also be uploaded, for those that are more comfortable using `R`. However, the main programming language for this course will be `Julia`. No familiarity with `Julia` is assumed. We will be starting from basic principles.
